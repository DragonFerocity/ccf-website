                Welcome! We are excited for this coming fall - it represents not only the start to another school year,

                    <a href="/catalyst/gel_groups">Gel groups</a> are student led small groups that meet off-campus
                    weekly on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at various times. Since we have multiple studies going on,
                    you are sure to find a study that will be a encouragement to you. Gel groups are a great opportunity
                    to get to know others on a personal level and to dig deeper together into the Scriptures.
