                We are excited for this coming fall - it represents not only the start to another school year,
                but also the start to many new and exciting relationships. Here are some of the basics that you as
                incoming students or the parents of incoming students will want.

                <div class="garamond medium-text">
                    <a href="/catalyst/small_groups">Small groups</a> are student led small groups that meet off-campus
                    weekly on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at various times. Since we have multiple studies going on,
                    you are sure to find a study that will be a encouragement to you. Small groups are a great opportunity
                    to get to know others on a personal level and to dig deeper together into the Scriptures.
