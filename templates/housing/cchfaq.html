<h3>Are meal plans required and how does that work?</h3>
Meal plans are required for freshmen and sophmores.
This information can be obtained by contacting Residential Life on
campus as part of your enrollment process.

<h3>What is required of me as a CCH resident?</h3>
There are only a few things that are considered required or
mandatory as a CCH resident. Residents are expected to be 'above reproach'
		  (1st Timothy 3:2). As a resident of the CCH,
		  you are a representative of this ministry and of Jesus Christ to
		  others within the campus community. You are to live a life of
		  integrity and have the highest of moral standards. All residents are expected to:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Attend weekly church services at the local church of their choice. </li>
              <li>Participate in a Gel Group (weekly CCF small group Bible study).</li>
              <li>Attend and participate in the weekly CCF meeting - Catalyst. </li>
              <li>Participate in areas of service which are in keeping with those taught in the New Testament, i.e. ministering to the sick, elderly, and those in need, campus outreach, and evangelism.</li>
              <li>Attendance at one house retreat each semester and house meetings at beginning and ending of each semester, and periodically as needed.</li>
            </ol>

<h3>Is it ok for students to build light sabers in the CCH?</h3>
While it is unlikely that you will aquire the necessary parts in this region of space, anything is available through Amazon.com. Should you find yourself feeling fearful or angry (those are the paths to the dark side...), we ask that you <b>NOT</b> move forward with plans to construct the most elegant weapon for this civilized age in which we live. All other lightsaber building inquiries will be handled by the ministry staff on a case by case basis.
<h3>Does everyone have to wear a tie or is that one guy just weird</h3>
Why wouldn't you want to wear a tie? While clothing is required, wearing a tie is not. Choose you this day how you will dress, but remember...ladies dig a snazzy guy.
