    <p>Andy Conklin joined us in July 2011 to partner with Allen and Shandi in mentoring
    the students at Missouri S&amp;T and to help prepare them for a future of loving God and
    serving His people. He married his wife, Amy, in 2005 and they have three kids, Abby,
    Paige, &amp; Crawford. In addition to loving God and his family, you will usually find

    Shandi has been with us since 2012, serving as CCF's first women's campus minister.
    She is passionate about helping people view themselves as God does and appreciate
    Him more. When Shandi is not working with CCF she is usually helping with her
    church's high school students, reading, cooking, analyzing a movie, or harassing
    her husband, Ben. To her, life is an adventure and you are never guaranteed tomorrow,
    so she strives to live EVERY day as though it is her last, adn to never let a moment
    pass her by with regret.</p>
